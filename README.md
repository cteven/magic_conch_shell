![alt text](https://gitlab.beuth-hochschule.de/bengbros/magische-miesmuschel/-/blob/main/picture/installations.png "Installation")

We configured our project with "Desktop Qt 6.2.1 MSVC2019 64bit".


for building the GUI: 
- create a "debug" build with "CONFIG+=gui"
- for tests, it is "CONFIG+=test"



The gui opens, but the "listen" and "pulling" the cord does not work yet. 

Tests fill the recordings directory in /sounds.
